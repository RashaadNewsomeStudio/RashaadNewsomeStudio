Hi, I am Rashaad Newsome. I run Rashaad Newsome Studio LLC, a fine art production studio and lab working at the intersection of assemblage, technology, sculpture, video, music, performance, and critical pedagogy.
I am interested in radical reimaginings of artificial intelligence and the ways that those models can be engaged to improve the lived experiences of ALL people. I’m currently learning about building machine learning models and the pressing ethical, privacy, and consent issues surrounding the use of generative models. I’m looking to collaborate with folks who are proficient in ML and have similar interests that the studio has. You can reach me via www.rashaadnewsome.com or @rashaadnewsome on Instagram.
